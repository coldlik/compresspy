Python scripts, that I've created for my personal uses

Most of these scripts are designed to only work with @f0e's mpv-cut script. (For now)

- c.py > automatically compresses video to ~25MB for uploading to discord etc.
- cb.py > same as c.py, but it blurs the video with tekno's blur before compressing it.
