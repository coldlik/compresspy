Python scripts, that I've created for my personal uses.

---

### __Usage:__

Either drag a video file onto the script, or launch it by typing the script name + "file name" in the folder path bar (e.g `c.py "video"`,
if the file's extension is .mp4, it doesn't need to be there.

---

- c.py > automatically compresses video using ffmpeg to ~25MB for uploading to discord etc.
- cb.py > same as c.py, but it blurs the video with tekno's blur before compressing it.

__experimental__
- test.py > c.py + cb.py combined, has a CLI menu and a function that merges multiple video files.
